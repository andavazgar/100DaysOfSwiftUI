# Project 11: *Bookworm*

An app that tracks which books you’ve read and what you thought of them (review and rating).


## Topics

**Property Wrappers:** `@FetchRequest`, `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)`  
**Views:** `AnyView`  
**Other:** `Core Data` (`NSManagedObject`, `NSManagedObjectContext`, `NSSortDescriptor`)


## Challenges

> 1. Right now it’s possible to select no genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing a default, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.
> 2. Modify `ContentView` so that books rated as 1 star have their name shown in red.
> 3. Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning `Date()` to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in `DetailView`.
