# Project 13: *Instafilter*

> An app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects.


## Topics

- CoreImage Framework: `CIFilter`, `CIContext`
- Conversion between: `CIImage`, `CGImage` and `UIImage`
- How to integrate UIKit in SwiftUI by using `UIViewControllerRepresentable`
- How to pick an image: `UIImagePickerController`, `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`
- `ActionSheet` and Custom Bindings


## Challenges

> 1. Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
> 2. Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
> 3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
