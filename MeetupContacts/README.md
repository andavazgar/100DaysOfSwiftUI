# Milestone 5: *MeetupContacts*

> Your goal is to build an app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported. The full collection of pictures they name should be shown in a List, and tapping an item in the list should show a detail screen with a larger version of the picture.
>
>Breaking it down, you should:
>
> - Wrap `UIImagePickerController` so it can be used to select photos.
> - Detect when a new photo is imported, and immediately ask the user to name the photo.
> - Save that name and photo somewhere safe.
> - Show all names and photos in a list, sorted by name.
> - Create a detail screen that shows a picture full size.
> - Decide on a way to save all this data.
>
> When you’re viewing a picture that was imported, you should show a map with a pin on that marked where they were when that pin was added. It might be on the same screen side by side with the photo, it might be shown or hidden using a segmented control, or perhaps it’s on a different screen – it’s down to you.
